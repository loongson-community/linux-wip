/*
 * Loongson-3's SFB (Store-Fill-Buffer) may buffer writes indefinitely when a
 * tight read loop is executed, because reads take priority over writes & the
 * hardware (incorrectly) doesn't ensure that writes will eventually occur.
 *
 * Since spin loops of any kind should have a cpu_relax() in them, force an SFB
 * flush from cpu_relax() such that any pending writes will become visible as
 * expected.
